- What is Github?
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides a space for developers to host (store) and 
manage their source code using git repositories in order to track changes and collaborate 
with others on a project.

- Creating a Github Account
a. On your browser, go to "https://github.com/" and click on "Sign Up" button
b. Enter your working email address and click on "continue" button for verification
c. Fill in the form provided for you and submit 
d. Once you've verified your email, you'll be directed to your GitHub dashboard.

- Creating a New Repository
a. On your account Dashboard, Click on the "+" sign beside a search box in the upper-right corner 
of the account page
b. Choose "New repository" from the drop-down menu
c. Fill in the repository name, usually the name of your project
d. Add a description (optional but recommended)
e. Choose Public repositories as they are visible to anyone, and does not require Github subscription
f. Initialize the repository with a README if you want to create a README file for your project
g. Click the "Create repository" button to create the repository.

- Cloning the New Repository
* Cloning of a repository is by copying the repository (or git folder/directory) created on 
github into your local machine (system).
* Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project repository.
* Clone the repository using the following instructions:

1. Direct Cloning
* Open a terminal on Linux or macOS, or a command prompt ( or git Bash terminal preferably) on Windows
* Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository
* Use the git clone command with the repository URL you copied from the github after creating your repo.
* For example, "git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git"
* NB: "username" is your github account name while "repository.git" is the name repository you have created 
and end it with ".git" 

2. Using SSH
* If you're using SSH, you can copy the SSH URL from your github repository page:
* For example, the SSH looks like this - "git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git"

3. Using Personal Access Token (PAT)
a. Create a GitHub personal access token (PAT):
* Go to your GitHub account settings and click the Personal Access Tokens tab.
* Click the Generate new token (classic) button.
* Enter a name and description for your PAT.
* Select the permissions and scopes that you want your PAT to have. 
NB: "repo" permissions are be checked in order to allow you to push to remote server 
* Click the Generate token button.
* Your PAT will be displayed in a text box. Copy and store your PAT in a secure location. 
* You will need this PAT to authenticate to GitHub using the command line or third-party apps and services.
* Once you have created a PAT, you can use it to authenticate to GitHub by cloning a 
repository or pushing changes to a repository.  

b. Clone a repository using the PAT
* Open a terminal (Git Bash terminal preferably).
* Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
* Clone the repository using the following command:
 
"git clone https://token (PAT)@github.com/<username>/<repository>.git"

* Replace <username> with your GitHub username, <repository> with the name of the 
 repository you want to clone, and token (PAT) with your generated PAT. For Example,

 "git clone https://PAT@github.com/chenYong/my_project.git"

* Once the repository has been cloned, you can navigate to it using the "cd" command and 
start working on the code.
